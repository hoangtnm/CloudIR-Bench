We do not have an estimated time to full restoration at this time, and are working to provide that.\n\n00:20 UTC on 20 Sep 2023: We've restored access to a majority of Project data.

While restoring data, we experienced a replication interruption which affected Git Operations, Issues and APIs. We restarted replication, and restored Projects data to its state prior to the rollout, and continue working to restore the last of Project metadata updated since 19 Sep 20:57 UTC.\n\n02:35 UTC on 20 Sep 2023: Projects data has been restored to the state prior to the incident (19 Sep 20:57 UTC).

We have restored all data from before the incident, up to 19 Sep 20:36 UTC. Project data modified between 20:36 UTC and 20 Sep 00:06 UTC was partially restored.
