Between 07/03/2022 11:08 PM UTC to 10/03/2022 11:19 AM UTC a number of Connect apps could receive install webhooks in the wrong region that could lead to the broken installations. We are aware of 24 number of apps being affected. We have identified the root cause and the feature affecting the behaviour is turned off. No new installations will be affected by this. We're trying to understand if we can trigger re-installations for affected apps. If this is not possible, we will reach out to the affected app owners. We will provide more details within the next hour.\n\n13:17 UTC on 10 Mar 2022: We have identified 16 potentially affected apps that could possibly be affected. This issue affects the apps with data residency setting enabled. We couldn't identify the broken installations based on our research. We have identified the root cause and the feature affecting the behaviour is turned off. No new installations will be affected by this. We will trigger the installation sync process tomorrow: this should fix the potentially broken installations in approximately 24 hours. We will also keep monitoring the support requests. We will provide more details once the fix is delivered.\n\n16:23 UTC on 10 Mar 2022: We have confirmed that some of the aforementioned 16 apps with enabled data residency were affected. We're working on deploying a hotfix right now. After the hotfix is deployed, we will trigger the installation sync process that will send installation hooks to all of the affected tenants to the correct region. This will happen in the next 6-12 hours. We will provide more details once the fix is deployed.\n\n00:17 UTC on 11 Mar 2022: We have released fixes to Jira and Confluence for the underlying issue that caused this incident. The consequence of which is that all future installs from this point onwards will respect the region-based routing found in App descriptors. This means that there should be no new instances of installation events being sent to the wrong routes. Starting shortly, in the next hour, we intend to start sending out reinstallation events to all of the Jira or Confluence products that had Apps installed that were affected by this incident. App developers should notice these reinstallation events hitting their Apps. This change will roll out over a 24 hour time period as per our standard Cloud rollout strategy.\n\n11:23 UTC on 11 Mar 2022: We have sent reinstallation events to all but two apps' tenants and got confirmation that the fix is working fine. We have turned on the process of sending reinstallation events for the rest of the apps and it should finish within the next 24 hours. We will keep monitoring the progress and send the next comms once the job is finished.\n\n11:49 UTC on 12 Mar 2022: Between 07/03/2022 11:08 PM UTC to 10/03/2022 11:17 AM UTC, 16 Connect apps with enabled data residency setting could receive reinstallation hooks in the wrong region.
