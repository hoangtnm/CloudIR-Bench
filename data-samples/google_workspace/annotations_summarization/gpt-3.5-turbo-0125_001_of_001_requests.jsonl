Based on the internal determination the call routing is completed successfully. A code change deployed to improve the call routing logic caused a misclassification of the incoming and outbound calls. The misclassification of the calls was caused due to a missing criteria field that the code change could not parse successfully. Further investigation into the incident revealed that the call router returned internal error while processing the call and eventually disconnected the calls with a Service Unavailable error.\n\"\"\"\nConcise Summary:"}], "logprobs": false, "temperature": null, "n": 1}}

It relies on the YouTube streaming infrastructure and the YouTube player to view livestreams in the browser. The trigger of the incident was a recent software update, which introduced an issue that resulted in the video player failing to recognize Meet livestreams and failing to start live playbacks. The change was initially pushed to 1% of users, and after monitoring for a period of time with no issues observed, Google engineers followed established practices and pushed the change to 100% of users in production. Errors that occurred during this period, however, were missed during the initial rollout, because our monitoring did not properly incorporate signals from Meet's player. Once the change was pushed to 100%, the issue's frequency increased. The errors that occurred due to the change also led to additional internal API traffic due to retry behaviors, which overloaded our servers.\n\"\"\"\nConcise Summary:"}], "logprobs": false, "temperature": null, "n": 1}}
