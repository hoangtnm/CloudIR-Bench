    "summary": "On Wednesday, 6 July 2022 16:12 US/Pacific, Google Voice experienced an issue with call routing for a duration of 55 minutes. For the duration of the incident, incoming and outgoing voice calls from Google Voice could not be completed, including any redialing attempts.",

    "root cause": "Google Voice utilizes a backend call router configured to determine the call flow and the product of the call. Based on the internal determination the call routing is completed successfully. A code change deployed to improve the call routing logic caused a misclassification of the incoming and outbound calls. The misclassification of the calls was caused due to a missing criteria field that the code change could not parse successfully. Further investigation into the incident revealed that the call router returned internal error while processing the call and eventually disconnected the calls with a Service Unavailable error.",
    "mitigation": "Once the incident was detected, Google engineers began remediation immediately, according to the timeline below (all times in PDT):\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 4:12 PM, the incident was detected.\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 4:14 PM, the incident response was initiated by an engineer who conducted an impact assessment.\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 4:22 PM, the incident was escalated to the wider team and root cause investigation began.\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 5:03 PM, a misconfiguration in the GTP system was identified, and the configuration was rolled back.\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 5:07 PM, the configuration was successfully restored to the latest known good version.\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 5:10 PM, internal verification indicated that the issue was resolved.\n* On Wednesday, July 6, at 5:19 PM, the incident was marked as mitigated.",
    "long-term mitigation": "* Improve the continuous deployment strategies to minimize the customer impact before rollout of updates.\n* Further improve validation and unit testing for call routing configuration changes before rollout.\n* Enforce code change blocks when dependencies are identified for high risk configuration changes and updates.\n* Enhance server-side detection logic for call routing configuration updates through continuous deployment.\n* Implement additional metric alerts and improve canary testing for client errors for call routing services.",

    "root cause": "Google Meet livestream allows Meet customers to stream meetings to a large number of viewers. It relies on the YouTube streaming infrastructure and the YouTube player to view livestreams in the browser. The trigger of the incident was a recent software update, which introduced an issue that resulted in the video player failing to recognize Meet livestreams and failing to start live playbacks. The change was initially pushed to 1% of users, and after monitoring for a period of time with no issues observed, Google engineers followed established practices and pushed the change to 100% of users in production. Errors that occurred during this period, however, were missed during the initial rollout, because our monitoring did not properly incorporate signals from Meet's player. Once the change was pushed to 100%, the issue's frequency increased. The errors that occurred due to the change also led to additional internal API traffic due to retry behaviors, which overloaded our servers.",
    "mitigation": "Google engineers were notified of the issue through a customer support case on Tuesday, 13 December at 03:12 US/Pacific and immediately began an investigation. Once the scope of the issue became clear, the incident was escalated at 04:53. The incident was further escalated to the YouTube team at 07:44. At 09:20, the root cause was identified, and engineers initiated a rollback of the software update. The incident was fully mitigated at 09:50, once the rollback completed.",
    "long-term mitigation": "* Implement a fix for the video player retry loop in the Meet player to prevent request overload.\n* Implement monitoring and alerting to detect failures to connect to livestreams in Meet and reduce mitigation time for issues of this type.\n* Investigate an alternative live streaming platform for Meet and remove dependency on YouTube.\n* Enhance testing in the staging environment to identify and prevent regressions before rollout progresses.",
