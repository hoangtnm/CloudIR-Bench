The Reservation server performs permission and quota checks and sends a request to the Capacity Manager server to approve capacity. In order to calculate available capacity in the region, Capacity Manager maintains a list that maps users to different data centers within the region. This information is continuously synchronized to a backend database. On 27 September 2023, an issue with the size of the data written to the database resulted in errors for some transactions. By 28 September 2023, at 06:00 US/Pacific, the transactions began to fail consistently, causing the Capacity Management system to enter a crash loop and preventing calculation of available capacity in the region and causing failures in slot purchase approval.\n* [4] <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rpc>\n\"\"\"\nConcise Summary:"}], "logprobs": false, "temperature": null, "n": 1}}

Engineers initially determined that the start of the issue aligned with a recent release and initiated a rollback at 10:13 US/Pacific. At 10:42 US/Pacific, testing showed that the rollback had not mitigated the issue. Due to the nature and scope of the issue, engineers began manually approving slot requests. At 11:50 US/Pacific, engineers implemented auto-approval for all slot requests in the US multi-region as a temporary mitigation while the root cause was investigated further. Engineers were able to fully mitigate the issue at 17:12 US/Pacific by reducing the size of the database transaction. Once the mitigation was confirmed, engineers rolled back the temporary auto-approval change.\n\"\"\"\nConcise Summary:\n"}], "logprobs": false, "temperature": null, "n": 1}}
