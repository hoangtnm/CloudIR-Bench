I want you to act as an expert software engineer. You will be given an incident report submitted on the {platform} portal.

Your task is to determine whether the report explicitly includes **at least one** of the following:
- A **clear root cause** that explains why the incident occurred (not just symptoms or contributing factors).
- **Specific and detailed mitigation steps** describing what actions were taken to resolve or remediate the incident (not vague or generic statements).

Respond with only one word:
**Yes** — if either the root cause or detailed mitigation steps are present.
**No** — if both are missing.

Incident Report: """

Output:
